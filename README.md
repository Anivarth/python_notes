# python_notes
This is the notes of the official documentation of python.

If you have learnt python programming from python official documentation then you would have noticed that the documentation assumes some prior knowledge of programming. 
But as python is considered as the most successful and easy language, many new programmers have started using python.
So I wanted to write a booklet for python so that every user even though it is beginner or a programmer he/she should be able to use it.
For this my first contribution is the notes which I have taken from python official documentation. This is the version 1.0

## Okay that's nice how can I contribute?
<b>Every one can contribute</b> for this project. If you <b>have read python</b> then you can contribute by finding errors in the code which I have taken in the notes. Also you can give suggestions on how the book can be written so that the beginners feel enough challenging to complete the whole book.
If you are <b>good in finding grammer mistakes</b> then you can contribute by finding errors in grammer.
If you have <b>prior programming language experience</b> then you can contribute by giving suggestion on how the book should be written so that it will not make the programmers feel that they are again learning the same thing.

## There are many books out there, how is this different from others?
That's a very good question. There are many good books online which are free. This book will be different in many ways. Some of them are:
* Replica of Python documentation for beginner programmers.
* More number of examples than the official documentation.
* Difficult problems for experienced programmers. (There will be stars(*'s)) to denote the difficulty rating.
* <b>Contribution by many programmers like you</b>, which can simply be said as the people have shared their experiece through this book.
* If possible I will design a website so that the book can be made interactive.
* Compact and concise. Neat. Elegant.
* And many more...

## Why are you doing this?
When I first heard about <b>Open Source</b> I liked it. So I wanted to contribute something to open source. Also I wanted to share my knowledge which I have learnt, so I wanted to write a book. I have chosen python. 


## What will I get for contributing?
First of all remember that you are contributing for a open source project. Your name will be added in the list of contributors which even includes my name. Many beginner programmers who will read this book will in some way say thank you by heart. You can be proud by contributing something to open source.

## How much will you charge for the book after it is complete?
I will not charge even a single penny for this open source project. This is free and will be free till the end of this world. But you can donate for this project to support the cause for which it is created. 

## Can I donate for this project?
Yes, you can donate for this project. I will create a fund raising campaign soon and then you can contribute your donations at that place. The amount will be spent for distributing the hard copy of the book to the children or people who are willing to learn programming. 
## How are my donations used?
You may have a doubt that "For writing a book which has contributors, why is this guy asking for donations?". The answer is simple - All the donations will be used for social cause like conducting events to encourage programmers, distributing the hard copy to people who are willing to learn programming. In one word, all the donations will be used as used by an NPO(Non Profit Organization).

## Can I see how my donation(s) was used?
Yes but not exactly the amound you have donated. I will post all the donations which I receive and all the expenses on my blog <a href="http://radiusofcircle.blogspot.com">Radius Of Circle</a>. In this way the donations will be transparent. 

## Can I share this book?
Yes you can share this book. But sharing of this book is governed by <a href="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International</a>

## Can I print and sell this book?
No you can't print this book for selling it. You can only print it for your personal use. You can print the book if you want to share it to people for free. 

## I don't know LaTeX, how can I contribute?
See the "I don't know how to use git, but I want to contribute" (next)section to find my contact details and send me a message and I will help you to contribute.
